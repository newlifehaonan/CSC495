Amazon Music Product Network Analysis

* Amazon is an online marketplace with millions of products and a massive amount of reviews. Certainly, within these product and user networks of interaction live a plethora of social network analysis insight and business benefit. In our study, we chose to focus on the Music category of products hoping to find a correlation between how users leave reviews and the genres the products belong to. Our dataset provided review helpfulness scores and ratings which we chose to focus on as they provide a fairly straightforward indication of sentiment about a review. Helpfulness measures how many users found a review “helpful”, indicating the quality of the review. Rating is assigned by the review author and is a quantified measure of their satisfaction with the product they are reviewing.

* Our hypothesis was that helpfulness and rating would be correlated to product genres, in a way indicating the sentiment induced by that particular genre of music. Does rap elicit more controversy? Are there genres of rock that more negative users gravitate towards, causing the genre to have more negative reviews and lower helpfulness ratings? We explored these questions and our answers came up with some interesting insights, but are ultimately inconclusive, though later studies could employ some of these methods to build on our findings.
